            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h2> Hello all, let’s dive into GIS and UX!</h2>
            <p>
                GIS isn’t just a field of study for me it’s a way to make a difference. I’ve always been fascinated by the power of location data to reveal patterns, solve problems, and improve lives. Whether it’s mapping accessibility, planning smarter cities, or visualizing environmental change, I believe GIS has the ability to bring clarity to complex challenges and drive meaningful action.

                One of my most rewarding projects was GeoConnect Prince Edward County (PEC), where I used spatial trend analysis and multi-criteria decision-making to help identify suitable housing sites. Seeing how data-driven insights could support urban planning and impact real communities deepened my passion for using GIS to create solutions that truly matter.

                At Wipro Technologies, I worked with enterprise GIS applications and infrastructure mapping, gaining hands-on experience in large-scale geospatial solutions. It was here that I learned the importance of designing GIS tools that aren’t just functional, but also accessible and user-friendly ensuring that those who rely on spatial data can make informed decisions with ease.

                More recently, I’ve been exploring UX in GIS through my volunteer role with BeSpatial Ontario as a Web Designer. By applying UX research and data-driven insights, I’m working to make GIS applications more intuitive, bridging the gap between technology and human experience. <i>Because at its core, GIS isn’t just about data it’s about people.

                Every map tells a story, every dataset has a human impact, and that’s what drives my passion for this field. As I continue my journey, I’m excited to learn, collaborate, and contribute to projects that make spatial data more meaningful, accessible, and impactful</i>.

                If you’re passionate about spatial analysis, UX in GIS, or using geospatial technology for real-world impact, I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!  </p>
