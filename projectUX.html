            <h2>Blackboard Grades Section</h2>
            <p>Through redesigning the grades section in Blackboard, 
                I gained valuable insights into user-centered design, particularly 
                in identifying and addressing usability gaps in educational platforms. 
                I applied Nielsenâ€™s heuristics and gathered feedback from students to understand 
                their pain points, such as difficulties with grade weightings, lack of 
                clear feedback visibility, and challenges in comparing grades with classmates. 
                The struggle was in balancing comprehensive functionality with a streamlined, 
                user-friendly interface, especially when optimizing for both desktop and mobile 
                experiences. Overcoming these challenges involved iterative prototyping, refining 
                interactions, and ensuring the final design supported clear, actionable feedback 
                to enhance students' learning outcomes. This project strengthened my skills in user 
                research, prototyping, and iterative design, highlighting the importance of continuous
                 user testing to create intuitive and effective solutions.

            <h2>This is a mobile prototype for the same section</h2>
            <p>In designing the mobile prototype for Blackboard's grades section, 
                I deepened my understanding of mobile-first design principles and the unique 
                challenges of creating a responsive, user-friendly interface for students. Through 
                user feedback and my research, I identified key pain points like difficulty navigating 
                grade breakdowns and accessing timely feedback. The struggle was in optimizing the interface
                 to deliver essential information clearly on a smaller screen while ensuring intuitive 
                 navigation. I focused on simplifying interactions, such as incorporating a course 
                 carousel and prominently displaying feedback, without overwhelming the user. 
                 Iterating the design for mobile required careful consideration of touch interactions, 
                 visual hierarchy, and space constraints, ultimately leading to a streamlined prototype 
                 that aims to enhance student engagement and support better learning outcomes. 
                 This experience reinforced the importance of user testing, adaptability, and designing 
                 for varied screen sizes to meet the needs of diverse users.
