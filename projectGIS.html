            <h2>GeoConnect Prince Edward County</h2>
            <p>
                Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in using GIS to address real-world challenges, particularly in rural connectivity and infrastructure planning. Working with large datasets taught me the importance of data cleaning and optimization for smoother processing in ArcGIS Pro. I also learned how to analyze broadband accessibility and visualize service gaps, deepening my understanding of digital equity in rural areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I encountered missing census tract data for PEC, I had to think critically and find alternative sources like the Esri Living Atlas, which strengthened my problem-solving skills. Mapping housing and population trends over time helped me see how spatial analysis can support decision-making for community development. Additionally, working with road networks and broadband expansion data reinforced how GIS can bridge the gap between technology and public services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Digitizing bus stops and creating transit routes in Picton gave me practical insights into how GIS is used in transportation planning. Overall, this project not only refined my technical skills but also gave me a deeper appreciation for how geospatial data can drive meaningful change in communities.

            <h2>Transit Network for Lindsay</h2>
            <p>
                In March 2024, we as a group of 4 developed a transit system application using ArcGIS Experience Builder, integrating GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data for real-time transit information. This involved creating table views for transit stops, adding routing capabilities, and implementing GTFS feeds to display bus schedules and routes.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I successfully integrated core features like directions widgets and schedule displays, I faced challenges with CSV file integration, GTFS data synchronization, and trigger functionality. This project taught me the importance of standardized transit data formats and spatial data attributes, and it highlighted the complexities of web GIS application development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I gained hands-on experience in web GIS development, GTFS data management, data relationships, and transit system visualization, all while learning how to address technical challenges through documentation and troubleshooting.

            <h2>Water Infrastructure Risk Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                I developed a comprehensive vector-based risk analysis system to facilitate infrastructure asset management for the City of Peterborough's water distribution network. This project implemented the ISO Standard for Risk and Resilience Management, analyzing risk as a function of likelihood, vulnerability, consequence, and resilience factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using advanced GIS modeling in ArcGIS Pro, I created automated workflows to assess multiple threat scenarios including natural disasters (flooding/freeze events), third-party damage from infrastructure maintenance, and pipe breaks due to material degradation. The analysis incorporated spatial proximity calculations, attribute-based queries, and multi-criteria evaluation to generate comprehensive risk indices for each water main segment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project involved complex spatial analysis including buffer operations, select by location queries, and field calculations to evaluate vulnerability based on proximity to water features, road networks, and land use classifications. I integrated socioeconomic impact assessments, environmental consequence modeling, and infrastructure criticality analysis to provide actionable insights for municipal asset management decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
                This work demonstrates my expertise in spatial modeling, risk assessment frameworks, and municipal infrastructure planning, directly supporting evidence-based maintenance scheduling and capital investment prioritization for critical water system assets.

            <h2>Network Analysis – Optimizing Ambulance Service Coverage & Routing</h2>
            <p>
                Using ArcGIS Pro's Network Analyst, I built a complete municipal road network model to support emergency medical services. The workflow included data preparation and topology correction where I imported Navteq street data, ambulance station locations, and incident points, then implemented topology rules to ensure full connectivity with no gaps, dangles, overlaps, or pseudonodes in the street network, followed by validation and correction of errors to maintain routing accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                I performed comprehensive attribute enrichment by adding and calculating key travel attributes, including road speed limits, segment distances in kilometers, and estimated drive times using the formula `([Distance] * 60) / [SpeedLimit]`. This was followed by network dataset creation where I built a topologically correct network dataset with custom travel modes and impedance set to drive time, allowing for precise time-based routing calculations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The analysis included Service Area Analysis where I generated multi-minute (1–6 minute) catchment zones around ambulance facilities to visualize coverage areas, identify underserved locations, and detect road network gaps that could impede emergency access. I also conducted Fastest Route and Closest Facility Analysis, running the Closest Facility solver to determine the shortest drive-time paths from ambulance stations to public service locations such as schools, pinpointing the optimal facility to respond to each incident.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quality assurance was achieved through creating a map book series for grid-based visual inspection, identifying network gaps, rebuilding the network after corrections, and comparing results against Esri's default network dataset for validation. This process delivered an accurate, high-performance GIS network model capable of supporting municipal decision-making for ambulance deployment, service coverage optimization, and emergency route planning.

                Using ArcGIS Pro's Spatial Analyst tools, I developed a least-cost trail route between two user-defined points in Yellowstone National Park by integrating multiple environmental and anthropogenic factors. This comprehensive analysis required sophisticated data preparation where I imported and organized raster and vector datasets for landcover, DEM, wolf sightings, existing trails and campsites, and road networks.

            <p>
                The criteria cost modeling involved multiple sophisticated analyses. For landcover, I reclassified habitat types into cost values based on suitability for safe human travel. Slope analysis included deriving slope in degrees from DEM, classifying into difficulty ranges, and assigning cost values. Wolf density analysis required creating a 1000 m² grid, aggregating wolf sighting data, interpolating with Kernel Density, and reclassifying into risk-based cost categories. Distance analyses included selecting and merging relevant features for campsites and trails, creating Euclidean distance surfaces, and reclassifying distances into cost values, as well as generating Euclidean distances from roads and assigning travel risk costs.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Weight assignment utilized the Pairwise Comparison method to assign criteria weights: Slope 30%, Landcover 20%, Wolf Density 20%, Distance to Campsites/Trails 20%, and Road Distance 10%. Surface combination applied the Weighted Sum tool to merge reclassified cost rasters into a Combined Surface Cost raster. The least cost path calculation involved digitizing origin and destination points, using Cost Distance and Cost Direction tools to generate cumulative cost surfaces, and applying the Cost Path as Polyline tool to extract the optimal trail route.

                Cartographic output and presentation included creating semi-transparent thematic layers over hillshade for visual clarity, publishing starting point, ending point, trail, and supporting layers as AGOL web layers, and building an interactive Esri StoryMap combining maps, workflow diagrams, and explanatory text to communicate methodology and results. The result was a data-driven, multi-criteria trail alignment that minimizes environmental disturbance, avoids high-risk wolf zones, and reduces human exposure to unsafe terrain, while maintaining accessibility.
